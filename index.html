        <h2>ABOUT COVID-19
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.[7] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.[8]</p>

        <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,[9] cough, headache,[10] fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[11][12][13] Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[14] Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[15] Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[16] Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[16]</p>

        <p> Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people are exposed to virus-containing respiratory droplets and airborne particles exhaled by an infected person.[17][18] Those particles may be inhaled or may reach the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person through touching or direct deposition (i.e. being coughed on).[17] The risk of infection is highest when people are in close proximity for a long time, but particles can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors in poorly ventilated and crowded spaces.[17][19] In those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[17] Touching a contaminated surface or object may lead to infection although this does not contribute substantially to transmission.[17][20] People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms.[21][22] People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to twenty days in severe cases.[23]</p>

        <p> Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.</p>

        <p> Preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions.

            While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus (and several vaccines for it have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have since initiated mass vaccination campaigns), the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.

                    <hr>
                    <p2 class="text-muted, text-left">We may not yet have vaccines or treatments against COVID-19, but there is one powerful combo that can help stop the spread of the virus, which many of us already have access to: soap and water.

                        There’s a reason why governments and public health experts worldwide have been telling us to wash our hands – it really works. Good hand hygiene could reduce cases of respiratory diseases by 20%, and diarrhoea by 30%. That means it has potential to have a huge impact on the spread of the coronavirus.
                        It works in the following way The virus itself if is made up of genetic material wrapped in a fatty coating. Soap molecules can disrupt this lipid membrane, causing it to fall apart. The virus’ “spike” proteins, which normally help it to invade human cells, are lost into the surrounding environment rendering the virus inactive. With the fragments of the virus enveloped by the soap molecules, these are then washed away when you rinse your hands.

                        The physical action of scrubbing your hands can also help to dislodge viral particles, which is why there has been so much emphasis on how we wash our hands and how long for. It does not matter how good your soap is if you do not apply it thoroughly enough.</p2>

                    <h4> <kbd>WEAR MASK </kbd></h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p2 class="text-muted, text-left">Analysis of over 75,000 confirmed cases in China found no evidence of airborne transmission of COVID-19. Instead the overwhelming evidence suggests that it is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and through contact.Transmission through respiratory droplets differs from airborne transmission in a number of critical ways. While both are capable of transmitting respiratory infections via droplets, it's the size of the droplets that matters.With an airborne disease, such as measles, a pathogen can be transmitted through aerosols, “droplet nuclei” that are less than 5 micrometres in size (5 millionths of a metre). These are small enough to stay suspended in the air for several hours and transmit infection through inhalation. This is one reason why measles is so infectious and capable of infecting someone entering a room even hours after someone with measles has left it. With COVID-19 the virus is spread via much larger respiratory droplets, of between 5-10 micrometres in size. These are too large to remain in the air for long and so instead fall onto nearby surfaces. Anyone close enough can be infected if the droplets land on or around their mouth, nose and eyes, or by touching a surface on which droplets have landed on and then touching their face. In light of this, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that individuals caring for others sick with COVID-19 wear masks to protect themselves, as they will need to come closer than two metres with patients and so be within the range of droplets. WHO also recommends that someone infected with COVID-19 wear a mask because it can act as a barrier when they sneeze or cough, reducing the spread of droplets.

                        Although these are the situations where wearing a mask is most beneficial for reducing the chances of someone infected spreading COVID-19, it may also be useful for other healthy individuals. For example, people may find it difficult to stay consistently at least two metres apart, such as workers who need to take public transport to work or people living in crowded slums or refugee camps. Such individuals may be at lower risk from COVID-19 than people who need to come into close contact with people who are known to be sick with COVID-19 as part of their job, but a mask could still provide valuable protection, especially since there is evidence that asymptomatic individuals can spread the COVID-19 virus. Similarly, it may prevent people from infecting themselves, even if they keep their distance, by unwittingly touching a contaminated surface and then unconsciously touching their face.

                        At the same time, mask-wearing does not replace other measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Handwashing, physical distancing when possible and individuals staying home when they are ill all remain very important. Wearing a mask should not provide a false sense of security, particularly as it works best in combination with other measures.

                        Governmental advice on the use of masks during this pandemic varies dramatically, given different circumstances and different assessments of governments of the risks and benefits of healthy people wearing masks if they are not in close contact with known COVID-19 cases. Some governments have gone beyond WHO’s recommendations to make it mandatory to wear a mask in public, giving police the power to issue on-the-spot fines to those who don’t. Nevertheless, individuals must be careful to observe all precautions against the spread of COVID-19 in force in their areas, whether or not that includes wearing a mask when healthy.

                    <h4> <kbd>MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING </kbd></h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p2 class="text-muted, text-left">Social distancing is a tool public health officials recommend to slow the spread of a disease that is being passed from person to person. Simply put, it means that people stay far enough away from each other so that the coronavirus – or any pathogen – cannot spread from one person to another.

                        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes social distancing as staying away from mass gatherings and keeping a distance of 6 feet or 2 meters – about one body length – away from other people. In New York City, for example, theaters have closed temporarily, many conventions around the world are being canceled and schools are closing all across the U.S. I’ve stopped taking the train during rush hour. Now I either work from home or drive in with my wife, or I take the train during off-hours so I can maintain the 6-foot distance.

                        Social distancing also means not touching other people, and that includes handshakes. Physical touch is the most likely way a person will catch the coronavirus and the easiest way to spread it. Remember, keep that 6-foot distance and don’t touch.</p2>

        <p>
            Less common symptoms:
            aches and pains
            sore throat
            diarrhoea
            conjunctivitis
            headache
            loss of taste or smell
            a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes
        </p>
        <p>
            Serious symptoms:
            difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
            chest pain or pressure
            loss of speech or movement
